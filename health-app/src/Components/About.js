                        Our basic idea is to create a website that has complete information regarding every doctor that
                        can be available in a particular city in a specific time schedule. This can be really helpful for all the patients 
                        who need specific treatment and are unaware of the particular doctorâ€™s availability schedule in different hospitals.
